## Hi there, I'm Alex 👋

I am a software developer and a recent graduate of the Le Wagon Tokyo bootcamp.

I am passionate about getting into the software engineering industry and creating apps to enhance user experience through quality of life innovations. I have a strong interest in front end technologies, and love JavaScript for all it can do to craft an interactive experience. Through the bootcamp, I also discovered my aptitude for back end technologies as well, and am highly adept at using Ruby on Rails and its front end partner Hotwire/Stimulus.

I am a keen learner, and always looking for the next skill to pick up to broaden my capabilities. I'm also very friendly, so if you'd like to know more about me, please feel free to contact me and chat anytime!
